## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.3] - 2022-02-28

### Added

- `useInnerBulmaProps` function to replace the `withBulmaProps` Higher Order Component

### Changed

- `tsconfig` was updated to use strict compilation rules.
- Every single component that was exporting the component using `withBulmaProps` (i.e. all of them) has been altered to instead use the `useInnerBulmaProps` function.
- The types for the non-trivial components has been altered in the cases where an additional helper type was required to integrate with the higher order component.
- The types for Void Function Components has been changed to omit `'children'` from the props object type.

### Removed

- `withBulmaProps` higher order component has been removed in favor of using the hook internally.
  - The helper function `withBulmaProps` is no longer exported in the external API to incentivize calling the hook instead.
- Removed deprecated components whose functionality is covered by the polymorphic component replacements
